# TPD-Satadeep
This application calculates the temperature programmed desorption rate. The program is written in C++ and Qt.
Once initial coverage, heating rate, desorption energy, temperature range etc are provided the program solves Polyani-Wigner differential equation using Runge Kutta method and prints the coverage and rate in a two column file "Coverage.dat". Currently the application works for only Linux,
later it will be updated for MAC and windows.
Download the Application file. Change the permissions (in bash you may issue: chmod 700 TPD.run)
