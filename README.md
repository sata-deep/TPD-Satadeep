# TPD-Satadeep
This program calculates the temperature programmed desorption rate. Once initial coverage, heating rate, desorption energy, temperature range etc are provided the program solves Polyani-Wigner differential equation using Runge Kutta method and prints the coverage and rate in a two column file "Coverage.dat". Currently the application works for only Linux,
later it will be updated for MAC and windows.
